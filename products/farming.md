Farms allow users to earn ROCO while supporting Roco Finance by staking LP Tokens

### How to Use Farms?

Unlike Stake Pools, Farms require you to stake two tokens to get LP Tokens, which you then stake in the Farm to earn rewards. This lets you earn ROCO while still keeping a position in your other tokens!

* You’re going to need some "LP Tokens" to enter into a Farm with. Farms can only accept their own exact LP Token; for example, the ROCO-AVAX Farm will only accept ROCOAVAX LP Tokens.
* To get the exact LP Token, you'll need to provide liquidity for that trading pair. So to get ROCO-AVAX LP Tokens, you'll first have to provide liquidity for the ROCO-AVAX pair. 

  Before you proceed, you'll want to choose a Farm that's right for you. Visit the Farms page and you’ll see a list of available Farms.

* Click on the row of the Farm you've chosen from the list. It will open to show more details. 
* On the left, you'll see some links. Click the Get \(your pair\) LP link. This will open the Add Liquidity page for your Farm's pair at Pangolin. 
* Pangolin has a guide to adding liquidity you can follow to get your LP Tokens.
* When you’re ready, click the Enable button and confirm your action in your wallet. After a short wait, the Enable button will change toFarm. Click it and a new window will appear. 

  Type the amount of LP Tokens you would like to farm with into the field, or just click Max to use all of your LP Tokens. When you have the amount entered, the Confirm button 

  will light up. Click it. Your wallet will ask you to confirm your action. After a short wait, the window will close, and you will see your new staked LP Token balance in the details.

### Removing LP Tokens from a Farm

You may decide you would like to add more LP Tokens to a Farm at a later date, or to take some out of a Farm. You can do this very easily whenever you'd like.

* Find the Farm you have LP Tokens in, and click the row to view details. You will see unstake button on the middle side. Click unstake to remove your LP Tokens

### Collecting your farming rewards

Farming will bring you ROCO rewards over time. You can collect these rewards and use them to get more LP Tokens, stake them in Stake Pools.

* Return to the Farms page . 
* Find the Farm you staked your LP Tokens in, and click the row to view details. You should see an estimate of your rewards under “Roco earned”. 
* Click the Harvest button and confirm the action in your wallet. After a short wait, the ROCO will be claimed to your wallet for you to use as you like.
* Remember that there is a small fee involved in each harvesting.
