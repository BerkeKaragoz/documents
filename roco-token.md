# Roco Token

RocoStorageBase is an APPSTORAGE model. It is coded by deriving from the Diamond Storage method. \(Diamond Standard EIP 2535 by Nick Mudge\) Allows the use of Structs and State Variables in the RocoStorageBase library. 

This allows the use of Eternal Storage and Diamon Standard Upgradeable Contract infrastructures. EIP 170 Large contracts can be designed regardless of the 24.5KB Contract Limit Size limit. 

These Libraries are always transferable by inheritance. Access from other Agreements is very simple. Examples of AppStorage models include GHSTStaking and AaveGotchi.
